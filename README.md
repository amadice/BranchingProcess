# BranchingProcess
Some functions to simulate branching process(with immigration), branching random living in random environment, Harris tree, etc...

These functions were realized during **my Msc project** focusing  on Branching random walks at [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences AIMS sengal](http://www.aims-senegal.org/).
